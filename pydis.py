Try to make a simple one dimensional spectra reduction package

Based heavily on Python4Astronomers tutorial:
    https://python4astronomers.github.io/core/numpy_scipy.html

Plus some simple reduction (flat and bias) methods

Created with the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5-m telescope's
Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) in mind. YMMV

---
Steps to crappy reduction to 1dspec:

1. flat and bias correct (easy)
2. identify lines in wavelenth cal image (HeNeAr) and define the
    wavelength solution in 2D space
3. trace the object spectrum, define aperture and sky regions
4. extract object, subtract sky, interpolate wavelength space
